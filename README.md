This project is an analysis of viewing data pulled from my own personal Netflix account - data is available at ViewingActivity.csv. This is an ongoing work in progress.

In netflix_analysis.ipynb I used pandas to examine the viewing count, viewing time (overall and average), and titles viewed by different profiles on my account. I used Matplotlib to build a visual comparison of viewing count between different profiles and to visualize
the devices most commonly used and titles with the highest viewing counts.
