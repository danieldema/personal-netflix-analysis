# Personal Netflix Viewing Data Analysis

An analytical deep dive into personal Netflix viewing habits using real account data, including exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization to reveal viewing trends and preferences.

## Project Overview

This project uses real Netflix viewing data to perform an in-depth analysis of personal streaming habits across multiple user profiles. Using machine learning, the project identifies distinct viewing patterns, device preferences, and content consumption behaviors, culminating in a predictive model that can accurately classify users based on their viewing characteristics.

**Data Analysis & Processing:**
- Python (pandas for data manipulation and analysis)

**Machine Learning:**
- scikit-learn (logistic regression)
- Model evaluation metrics (AUC, confusion matrix)

**Data Visualization:**
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Key Insights from Analysis

**Profile Differentiation:**
- Distinct viewing patterns successfully distinguish between users
- Device preferences serve as strong identifying characteristics
- Viewing duration patterns reflect individual consumption habits

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Clear device-profile associations (mobile vs. TV vs. computer preferences)
- Content consumption volume varies significantly between profiles
- Temporal viewing habits show consistent individual patterns
